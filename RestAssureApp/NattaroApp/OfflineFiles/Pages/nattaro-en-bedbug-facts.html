        <h3>Biology</h3>
    </a><img src="res://Images/T/APP002T_72.png" width="90" height="90" alt="" align="right" />
    <p>
        Bed bugs are nocturnal parasitic insects, which like mosquitoes feed on human blood.
    </p>
    <p>
        An adult bed bug is approximately the size and shape of a linseed, it looks like a 1-5 mm long reddish brown small beetle.
    </p>
    <p>
        These insects hide together in small dark crevices close to us during the day. Bed bugs are only able to crawl
        and normally do not move over large distances. Longer dispersal patterns are achieved by passive hitch-hiking.

        <h3>Historic names</h3>

    <p>
        Bed bugs were recognized as a widespread problem in the western world during the 18th century. This ectoparasitic
        (parasite outside the body) insect has evolved in parallel with humans over a long period. Their long history with
        us humans is shown, not only in a large number of names and nick names (bed bug, bedbug, wall louse, mahogany flat,
        crimson rambler, heavy dragoon, chinche bug, and redcoat), but also by their presence in the well-known nursery
        rhyme (&quot;Good night, sleep tight and don't let the bed bugs bite..&quot;).
        Bed bugs in latin is &quot;Cimex lectularius&quot;.

        <h3>Development and longevity</h3>
    </a>
        <img src="res://Images/T/APP004T_72.png" width="90" height="90" alt="" align="right" />
    <p>
        Following hatching, the bed bug undergoes five developmental phases before it is able to reproduce. All stages
        are visible without the need of a microscope. When the bed bug has access to blood it can live for up to
        6 months, and if the food source disappear during this period the insect has an ability to hibernate up to
        200 days depending on temperature and will return to movement, feeding and reproduction when food sources return.
        Earlier developmental phases in bed bugs are more sensitive to lack of food, and the youngest nymphs are only
        able to live for a few weeks without access to blood.
    </p>

        <h3>Habitat</h3>
    </a><img src="res://Images/T/APP006T_72.png" width="90" height="90" alt="" align="right" />
    <p>
        The bed bugs live off us and not on us. They dwell in our immediate vicinity and are only on us
        while feeding on our blood, which is usually by night while the insects are most active and
        we are in our deepest sleep. The bed bugs preferably feed every 10th day, by penetrating our skin
        with their proboscis (tubular mouthpieces).
    </p>
    <p>
        If disturbed whilst feeding it will probe again, thus several bites can be made by one bed bug.
        It takes approximately 10 min for the insect to feed, and following this it seeks out a dark crevice
        to hide in close by the bed. In most cases bed bugs live together in groups (aggregations) where
        they leave their characteristic defecation (small black spots), shed their skin, mate and lay eggs.
    </p>
    <img src="res://Images/T/APP007T_72.png" width="90" height="90" alt="" align="left" />
    <p>
        The insects dwell underneath the bed, in the mattress, bed linen and on bedspreads.
    </p>
    <p>
        Other popular places are picture frames, cracks in the wallpaper, bedside table, lamps, upholstered furniture,
        skirtings, sockets, curtains as well as door- and window frames.
    </p>

        <h3>Reproduction</h3>
    </a><img src="res://Images/T/APP009T_72.png" width="90" height="90" alt="" align="right" />
    <p>
        Both male and female bed bugs need to feed on blood, preferably human, in order to be able to reproduce. They
        reproduce throughout their adult lifetime. A fully fed bed bug will become twice as big and is thicker and
        elongated compared to an unfed. The female bed bug is mounted by males immediately after feeding, and she will
        then mate several times with different males. The female will lay between 3-5 eggs per week during reoccurring
        mating occasions.
    </p>
    <img src="res://Images/T/APP010T_72.png" width="90" height="90" alt="" align="left" />
    <p>
        An adult female bed bug is able to lay around 500 eggs during her life-time. The eggs hatch within a week at 25°C,
        and slightly later at lower temperatures. An small almost transparent copy (nymph) of an adult bed bug hatches
        from the egg. The newly hatched nymph needs to feed within a week. Thereafter it sheds its skin and grows one
        size bigger.
    </p>
    <p>
        A bed bug undergoes five different nymphal stages and it needs access to blood during all of them, in order to
        be able to shed skin and grow to the next size. It takes five meals from egg to adult, and the whole development
        period takes approximately five weeks.

        <h3>Spread</h3>
    </a><img src="res://Images/T/APP012T_72.png" width="90" height="90" alt="" align="right" />
    <p>
        The bed bug is dispersed passively, i.e. we help the spreading by accidentally carry them in our things, such as
        luggage, clothes, used furniture, toys, books and also consumer electronics. As a consequence, examine carefully
        your luggage following a trip and be careful when you buy furniture and other things second hand. Always examine
        the things carefully before bringing them into your home, alternatively have them decontaminated by an expert
        before you start to use them.
    </p>
    <p>
        The presence of bed bugs is not influenced by how clean or dirty your home is, even though it might be more
        practical to take of an infestation and discover an infestation in a tidy room with fewer possible hiding places.
    </p>
    <br />

        <h3>Bites</h3>
    </a><img src="res://Images/T/APP016T_72.png" width="90" height="90" alt="" align="right" />
    <p>
        Bed bugs do not spread any infectious diseases, however their presence causes an extensive discomfort. An
        infestation may pose a considerable strain and be both difficult and costly to get rid off. The bites from bed
        bugs are similar to mosquito bites, but can vary depending on how sensitive you are. Swelling, redness and
        painful itching are common symptoms.
    </p>

    <img src="res://Images/T/APP017T_72.png" width="90" height="90" alt="" align="left" />
    <p>
        Some people develop an allergic reaction to the bed bug's saliva, which is injected while probing our skin. If
        you have never been bitten by bed bugs the effect from their bites may take more than a week (7-10 days) before
        reactions occur. This delay means that in some cases it may be difficult to determine where or when you were bitten.
        Skin reactions will show immediately if bitten repeatedly.

        <h3>Language of scents</h3>
    </a><img src="res://Images/T/APP019T_72.png" width="90" height="90" alt="" align="right" />
    <p>
        Insects, such as bed bugs, are using scents as cues to find hiding places, partners, egg laying sites
        and their food, i.e. humans.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the case of bed bugs we have through research identified the odour cues that bed bugs are using for example
        when there is "danger" (alarm pheromone), and also the chemical signals emitted from us that makes it possible
        for bed bugs to find its way to us in a room.
    </p>
    <p>
        Research also have indications on how the scents from an aggregation of bed bugs is used to find their way back
        to this spot after a meal.
    </p>
    <br />
    <a id="Fact%209__fact9">
        <h3>How they find us</h3>
    </a><img src="res://Images/T/APP020T_72.png" width="90" height="90" alt="" align="right" />
    <p>
        Like many other blood-sucking insects, bed bug makes use of signals that we humans give off in order to find its
        way to us. These signals are warmth of our bodies, carbon dioxide from our exhalation and scents we emit.
        Since bed bugs are attracted to heat when they are hungry, heat radiation from electronic equipment can be a
        place where you can find bed bugs &quot;gone astray&quot;.
    </p>

        <h3>Why they are back</h3>
    </a><img src="res://Images/T/APP022T_72.png" width="90" height="90" alt="" align="right" />
    <p>
        Bed bugs were common throughout the Western world until the postwar period. In England it was estimated that 75%
        of the homes had bed bugs during the beginning of twentieth century. This pest was eradicated with hydrogen
        cyanide and DDT from the majority of the industrially developed countries. The toxins DDT and hydrogen cyanide is
        now banned completely as an insecticide, due to extreme toxicity, and inability to break down in nature.
    </p>
    <p>
        During the last 10 years the number of bed bug infestations have increased once again, and this increase is due to
        widespread resistance to all approved pesticides, but is also due to our changed travel patterns. We travel more
        often and we travel further away on holidays and business trips than ever before.
    </p>
    <p>
        A factor contributing to the rapid spread is also our ignorance about the issue, we lack the knowledge of what a
        bed bug looks like, how or where it resides or how we might spread them through our lifestyle.
