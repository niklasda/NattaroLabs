    <p>
        All overnight trips pose a risk to bring the bed bugs home. This applies to both domestic and international travel.
        Low budget hotel / hostel is not a greater risk than an exclusive hotel. The bed bugs do not care how much you paid
        for your room. Do not stop traveling, just pay attention and be careful to not help the bed bugs spread to your home.
    </p>

    <p>
        Bites from bed bugs can be the first sign of an infestation. Remember that it may take up to 10 days between bites
        and rashes, especially if you've never been bitten by bedbugs before. Learn to recognize what a bed bug looks like,
        so you react when you see one. Look for small black dots (excrements) pale, dry skin pieces and small blood stains
        on the sheets, as they can be early signs of an infestation.
    </p>
    <p>
        The faster you find that you have been affected the easier it is to get rid off.

        <h3>Before the trip</h3>
    </a>
    <p>
        √ Extra plastic bags in various sizes
    </p>
    <p>
        √ Something to poke with in small crevices
    </p>
    <p>
        √ RestAssure offers the feature lamp and magnifying glass, feel free to use it when looking
    </p>
    <p>
        √ Pack supplementary bags of different sizes to keep clothing and electronics in.
        A bed bug can not chew through plastic or fabric.
    </p>

    </a><img src="res://Images/T/APP020T_72.png" width="90" height="90" alt="" align="right" />
    <p>
        √ Keep your luggage in the bathroom (for additional safety use the bathtub or shower)
    </p>
    <p>
        √ Look through the bed and adjacent furniture (please see where the hot spots are
        on the photo of a hotel room)
    </p>
    <p>
        √ Avoid keeping your suitcase on the bed or under it
    </p>
    <p>
        √ Use tightly sealed plastic bags for your clothes and other items you suspect may
        be a possible hide-out for the bed bugs
    </p>
    <p>
        Keep your bags in the bathroom / shower while you examine the room. 90% of all bed bugs in a room is in or close
        to the bed. Look under the mattress, in crevices, corners and behind the bed headboard. Use a flashlight or RestAssure,
        and something sharp to poke with when looking for bed bugs and signs from an infestation. Look for tiny black
        spots (bed bug excrement)/blood spots and light pieces of shell (their molt). Avoid putting your bags on the bed.
        If you find something you suspect to be a trace notify the hotel and demand another room.

        <h3>Returning home</h3>
    </a><img src="res://Images/T/APP033T_72.png" width="90" height="90" alt="" align="right" />
    <p>
        √ Store your bags outdoors or in a bathtub while unpacking them
    </p>
    <p>
        √ Wash all clothing, preferably at 60°C/160°F, tumble dry warm or use a drying cabinet
        for things that can withstand heat
    </p>
    <p>
        √ Have you had all the electronics, such as mobile, travel alarm clock, etc. under supervision or kept in a tightly
        fitting plastic bag the rest of the time during your stay, they should be safe from bed bugs
    </p>
    <p>
        √ Take advantage of your freezer (-18°C/-1°F for three days), ensure that all items are frozen
        straight through
    </p>
    <p>
        √ Use a sauna if you have access to such a facility (max 50°C/122°F for 12-24 hours),
        make sure that all items are warm right through. <b>NB!</b> Beware of the risk of fire!
    </p>

    <p>
        Do not bring your suitcases to the bedroom after the trip, but keep them if possible outdoors, in a storage room
        or other similar space. Wash, tumble dry or freeze all your clothes right after you return from the trip.
        Computers, mobile phones and books can also be protected with tightly fitting plastic bag. Remember, should you
        have the bad luck of returning home with bed bugs, it's not your fault. Bed bugs are not associated with poor
        hygiene and you are not alone with the problem. Consider how you may have gotten them. Was it from a journey?
        Second hand furniture, or any other item you have bought that already has been used. If you think you know where
        and why, you've probably found the origin of the problem and can then remove it. Immediately contact your
        insurance company and a pest control company you can trust.

        <h3>If you have been bitten</h3>
    </a><img src="res://Images/T/APP017T_72.png" width="90" height="90" alt="" align="right" />
    <p>
        There is no evidence that bed bugs can spread any diseases, but they are spreading discomfort and
        constitutes a nuisance. Bites from bed bugs may look like mosquito bites but they are often itching for
        a longer period. If the infestation in the room is large, it is not uncommon to have several bites on both
        arms as legs.
        <br />
        <br />
        If you have fewer bites or a few bites at one place, it can be an individual who bites
        several times. Perhaps because it was disturbed while feeding. Wash the bites well with a mild soap and
        lukewarm water, try to avoid scratching to prevent infection and possible scarring. To relieve the itch
        you can suppress it with a numbing ointment, ask your pharmacist for advice on which varieties are
        suitable. If the bites swell up and become bright red, there may be an allergic reaction, seek medical
        care for correct treatment.

        <h3>About the eradication</h3>
    </a><img src="res://Images/T/APP021T_72.png" width="90" height="90" alt="" align="right" />
    <p>
        An effective control of bed bugs requires new approaches and strategies of the pest control industry. Approved
        toxins soon become more or less ineffective. Cooperation between pest control companies and the residents will
        increase success. Eradication techniques usually start with a visual inspection of the room and furniture in
        order to locate were the bed bugs are. Cracks and crevices are then vacuumed. Sometimes the skirtings are also
        removed and  a long-term eradication powder is spread along or behind these. In addition, it is customary to
        spray the suspected hiding places with insecticide. Residents should not stay in the room / apartment immediately
        after the clean-up, for about 4 -24 hours, depending on the substances used. Pets and hypersensitive people,
        children, and pregnant women can for safety avoid residing in the room / apartment for up to two days.
    </p>
    <p>
        It may take up to 2-3 weeks to get rid of all the bed bugs and when the infestation is severe the eradication might
        have to be repeated. Please ask your contact person at the pest control company about how they are planning to
        deal with your infestation. One can not manage to eradicate bed bugs on their own, but you can keep the number
        down and facilitate the removal by correct actions. Ask the pest control technician about how you can be of help.
        If you suspect you have an infestation immediately contact a pest control company, your insurance company or your
        landlord if you live in a rented apartment. There are different rules and routines depending on where in the world
        you live regarding how to deal with an infestation.

        <h3>Facilitate the eradication</h3>
    </a><img src="res://Images/T/APP028T_72.png" width="90" height="90" alt="" align="right" />
    <p>
        It may take more than one visit from the pest control company and it is very important you pre-wash all linens
        and textiles, that are in or near the bed, for at least 60°C/140°F. Pack all bed linen and textiles in tightly
        sealed plastic bags and store them in these during the eradication, in order to avoid additional infestations.
        The items not fit to be washed in hot water can instead be frozen in plastic bags, such as cushions, bags and curtains.
        Store in freezer for at least 48 hours. Be sure to dispose of used plastic bags, do not reuse them.
    </p>
    <p>
        Prior to the eradication you should clean your entire home thoroughly and carefully follow the instructions provided
        by the pest control technician. Above all, it is important to clean floors, skirtings, furniture in the bedroom and
        adjacent closets. If you vacuum, or use the mop, be sure to immediately discard the vacuum bag in a tight plastic
        bag and wash the floor mop in 60°C/140°F. Do not move any furniture or things from the room until you are absolutely
        certain that the infestation is resolve. There may be a need to check that the bed bugs have not spread to couches or
        other places in the home.

        <h3>FAQ</h3>
    </a>
    <p>
        <em>"Do bed bugs fly?"</em><br />
        No, bed bugs are so called true bugs and have no wings. They are only able to crawl.
        <br />
        <br />
        <em>"Can bed bugs crawl up into the ceiling and let go in order to get down to the bed?"</em><br />
        It is quite likely that it could happen, but it is not a premeditated act. Their
        behavior is to move upward, and the result may then be that they happen to lose
        their grip and fall into the bed.
        <br />
        <br />
        <em>"Are bed bugs only in the bed?"</em><br />
        No, the common name, bed bug, is misleading since bed bugs are located where it is most likely to
        find food, which is in the bed. However, they may hide behind paintings, in electrical outlets, lamps,
        furniture, etc. but probably they are in these cases also found in the bed.
        <br />
        <img src="res://Images/T/APP021T_72.png" width="90" height="90" alt="" align="right" />
        <br />
        <em>"Do bed bugs spread any diseases?"</em><br />
        No. Several studies have examined diseases such as resistant bacteria, HIV and
        Hepatitis, and found that bed bugs can carry viruses and bacteria but
        not spread these to the host (us).
        <br />
        <br />
        <em>"Are there more bed bugs if it is dirty and unsanitary?"</em><br />
        No. bed bugs are spread with humans when we move our stuff between places. Where
        it is possible for bed bugs to find food and hiding place, they can survive and
        reproduce. Cleaning can perhaps help you find bed bugs earlier but you must also
        have knowledge about what it is you see. Historically it was considered that it
        was just the poor in bad houses that had bed bugs. That is not true.
        <br />

        <img src="res://Images/T/APP026T_72.png" width="90" height="90" alt="" align="right" />
        <br />
        <em>"Is the increase of bed bugs caused by immigration?"</em><br />
        No. People of all nationalities travel more than before. We are traveling more often and farther away than we
        ever have done before. The bed bugs are passive, free-riders that goes with anyone, anywhere and anytime.
        They don't discriminate anyone.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <em>"Do bed bugs live on us?"</em><br />
        Just as mosquitoes and ticks, bed bugs need us as food source. blood-sucking ecto parasites (parasites outside the body)
        leave us when they finished eating. It takes 10-15 min for bed bugs to feed.
        <br />
        <br />
        <em>"Does bed bugs tolerate the cold, or can I get rid of them if I open the window?"</em><br />
        Unfortunately, a slow, gradual cooling only makes them reduce their activity and results in hibernation
        and will then increase activity once again when conditions are more favourable. They will not survive a
        rapid and intense cold (-18°C/-1°F) for several days. Therefore you can use your freezer for the
        remediation of contaminated objects.
        <br />
        <br />
        <em>"Why don't pest control companies just spray poison so they disappear?"</em><br />
        The bed bug comeback is partly due to a heavy use of insecticides. They have become
        resistant (developed resistance) against the toxins and has a higher survival rate. Generous spraying
        may ultimately have an adverse impact when the insects
        instead are chased off to other rooms by avoidance, but they will not die.
        <br />
        <br />
        <em>"Can bed bugs lay eggs without mating?"</em><br />
        No, adult bed bugs are either males or females, and they need to mate to fertilize
        the eggs. The female may, after a mating, save sperm in the body for several
        weeks and are able to lay eggs during this time without any new mating. She does, however, need
        to feed to develop additional eggs. Thus one fertilized female bed bug is enough
        to start a major infestation in a room.
        <br />
        <br />
        <em>"Where should I start to look for bed bugs?"</em><br />
        The bed bugs are present close to the food source (us). 90% of all bed bugs in
        a room is in or close to the bed. Look under the mattress, in crevices, bed corners
        and behind the headboard. Remember to also examine the sofas and armchairs. Hardwood
        furniture can be a good hiding place, as long as it is dark and unexposed.
